# cursed-seagate-drive

This is the repository documenting a consumer seagate hard drive that seemingly should not exist as it does.

It has:
- Over **63,000 reallocated sectors**
- **Zero pending sectors**
- Firmware version **0001**
- Died **three times**, disappeared from BIOS, and in the first instance of death, it took eight months for it to resurrect.
- Survived running AI models, large transfers, and a chkdsk scan

I have no clue why this drive is still running (kind of reliably) when drives fail with *far* fewer reallocated sectors.

## ðŸª¦ Why This Is Here

I wanted to document it in some way, in case it ever did die permanently, and the fact that someone might know what is going on lol.

Partially helped by chatgpt, it was the one who pointed out how anomalous it was (and quite obviously helped with the formatting of this description). I'm still unsure of the extent of how unusual this drive is, feel free to contact me if you know about this stuff!
